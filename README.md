## Introduction

Stack is a simple card-style Hugo theme designed for bloggers, some of its features are:

- Responsive images support
- Lazy load images
- Dark mode
- [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) integration
- Archive page template
- Full native JavaScript, no jQuery or any other frameworks are used
- No CSS framework, keep it simple and minimal
- External dependencies (like PhotoSwipe's library) are being loaded selectively, or asynchronously
- Properly cropped thumbnails

The only JavaScript library being used is [node-vibrant](https://github.com/Vibrant-Colors/node-vibrant) for generating colour schemes for articles.
