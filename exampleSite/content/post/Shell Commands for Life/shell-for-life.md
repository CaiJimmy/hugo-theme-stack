# **Shells for Life**

Tired of life? Feeling sick of moving the damn cursor through the GUI? Then Ma Foi...you have landed at the best possible place to ease out your pain ( I know it hurts).

## 1. ls

Ohhh this can be a lifesaver when needed to view all the files in a directory (FYI: Folders are known as directories in Linux). Just type in this teeny weeny command and it willlllllll hurr out all the file names it can come across.

Still not satisfied??? Want some more??? There are a lot of flavours available for ls

`$ ls -a` lists all files including hidden files

`$ ls -A` lists all files, including hidden files, except a top directory

`$ ls -F` add an indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

`$ ls -S` sort by file size

`$ ls -al` provides a list of all the files in the same directory

`$ ls -l` Use a long listing format

`$ ls -nl` Use a long listing format with a user ID

`$ ls -c` list contents by columns

## 2. man

Want to command your pc but have no idea what it might eat away??? Behold everyone -- man pages to the rescue for you.

    $ man <command_name>

I know I know...you want options...here you go

`$ man -` Print a help message and exit

`$ man -V --version` Display version information and exit

`$ man -C` Use the configuration file rather than the default of \~/.manpath.

`$ man -d` Print debugging information.

## 3. cd

Sometimes I feel like I am not in the right place. So I simply call **cd** to take to the best place for me and this good human (so what I personify my commands!!!) like a free taxi delivers like some messenger of God. Basically, it takes changes the directory to the one of your preference.

Option Option Option!!!

**`$ cd /` **goes to the root directory

**`$ cd ..`** goes to a parent directory

**`$ cd` **goes to the user's home directory when executed without the parameter

**`$ cd ~root`** goes to the user's home directory when the user name is given after the ‘\~’

## 4. nano

**"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world" - Archimedes**

I don't have such demands...all I want is a place to write on...and that's what nano has to offer.

Nano is a command-line and very mouse unfriendly text editor to.

**`$ nano myscript.sh`**

## 5. mkdir

Sometimes I feel that if and only if I had some magic to create some folders in the remote server into whom I have ssh_ed into. Even you too feel so. 

Meanwhile, Linus babu(The Godfather of The Linux Foundation and the creator of the Linux) introduces to us the power of **$ mkdir folder** . This command may be simple looking but it is...trust me!!! All it creates a new directory where you want it to be...the perfect one, right??? 

That's all folks. This is just a birthday special I wanted to share with you all.
