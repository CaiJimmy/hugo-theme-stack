Some decisions in cycling stay timeless.  
Choosing between a springless leather saddle and a sprung one is one of them —  
a quiet but powerful fork in the road, shaping how you and your bicycle experience long journeys.

Both have their place. Both have their purpose.  
It simply depends on the kind of rider you are, and the kind of ride you dream of.

## The Springless Saddle: Pure, Direct, Timeless

A springless leather saddle strips things back to the essentials.  
It’s lighter, cleaner, and keeps you closely connected to the ride beneath you.

- **Weight advantage**: No coils, no extra hardware.  
- **Sharper ride feel**: Every pedal stroke feels crisp and efficient.  
- **Break-in reward**: Over time, the leather molds to your body, offering incredible comfort — without losing responsiveness.  
- **Perfect for**: Expedition touring bikes, randonneuring, classic endurance builds, riders who crave a direct and lively machine.

> *You don’t float above the road. You ride through it.*

## The Sprung Saddle: Comfort in Every Bump

Sprung saddles bring an old-world softness to the harshness of long miles and broken roads.  
Steel coils absorb the worst of potholes, cobbles, and rough backcountry tracks.

- **Heavier setup**: Springs add noticeable weight and bulk.  
- **Smoother ride**: Reduces jarring impacts, especially with heavy touring loads.  
- **Vintage charm**: Looks perfect on classic steel touring bikes and heritage builds.  
- **Perfect for**: Fully-loaded touring, city riding, broken highways, scenic slow journeys, riders prioritizing long-haul comfort.

> *You glide a little more, trading sharpness for quiet comfort.*

## My Choice: Riding Connected

When setting up my new touring bike, I had the chance to choose between both —  
a traditional springless saddle and a sprung one.

I chose the springless saddle.

Because for me, riding isn’t about floating over every bump.  
It’s about feeling the terrain, adapting, and moving with the landscape.

I'm not afraid to get up on the pedals when the road gets rough.  
I prefer a saddle that rewards engagement over ease —  
one that keeps me connected, present, and part of the ride.

## The Road Will Decide

If your dream is a touring bike that feels alive under you — light, sharp, ready for continents —  
a **springless saddle** keeps the spirit of adventure pure.

If you imagine slow days under heavy loads, dusty backroads, and the need for gentle forgiveness,  
a **sprung saddle** offers you a soft landing, again and again.

Neither is wrong. Each carries a different kind of poetry — a different rhythm to your travels.

**Choose the one that lets you fall in love with the ride, again and again.**
