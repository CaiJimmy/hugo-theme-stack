You’ll see him in corners of the website.  
Tucked into reviews. Peeking out from stories.  
Gliding through traffic. Waiting at a dhaba.  
A robe flapping. A fixie humming. A pair of round glasses catching the light.

**His name is Shunya.**

---

Shunya isn’t a reviewer.  
He isn’t a salesman.  
He isn’t even real — but he’s very much alive.

He’s the spirit of Gearlama.  
Curious. Quiet. Completely obsessed with the little things that make big rides better.

---

When we find gear that just works — not in a lab, but on bad roads, late nights, steep climbs —  
you’ll probably see Shunya riding alongside it.

He doesn’t overthink.  
He doesn’t scroll.  
He rides. Listens. Waits.

Sometimes, all he leaves behind is one note:

> *“This one stays.”*

---

You’ll find him where the journey meets simplicity.  
Where form follows function.  
Where a yellow fixie can outpace a city full of scooters, just by showing up with soul.

---

So no, Shunya isn’t just a mascot.  
He’s a reminder.

That even in a noisy world, there’s still space for calm rides, good gear, and stories worth telling.

And this is where his story begins.
