Stack theme has a built-in support for image galleries. It allows you to create a beautiful gallery by simply placing multiple images side-by-side.

## Sample Gallery

## How it works

The gallery is powered by **Photoswipe** and a custom internal script. It automatically calculates the best layout for your images based on their aspect ratios.

To create a gallery, you just need to put multiple images in the same line (or paragraph).

### Syntax

```markdown
![Image 1](image1.jpg)  ![Image 2](image2.jpg)

![Image 3](image3.jpg)  ![Image 4](image4.jpg)
```

> **Note**: There should be two spaces between the images to ensure they stay in the same line in Markdown
